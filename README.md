# A Virtual Reality Game for Oculus Go-TrashCatcher

Developed in the context of the course Human-Computer Interaction (2019) with Daniel Attard (University of Malta). \\

The game is to raise environmental awareness that the users need to catch the falling cocacola cans and other trash item getting thrown randomly on a forest terrain to keeping the tree around them alive. The more trash item they missed, the more trees start getting yellow and gradually dying off. \\
